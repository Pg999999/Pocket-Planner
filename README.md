Various popups for adding expenses, viewing notifications, and viewing profiles are toggled using event listeners. Popups are hidden or shown based on user interaction.

Expense and Analytics Updates:

Whenever an expense is added, the app checks if the spending exceeds predefined limits and updates the respective charts. Alerts notify the user of any excess.

Event Listeners:

Multiple event listeners manage user interactions such as adding an expense, changing filters, opening/closing panels, and navigating between tabs (e.g., notifications, profile).
